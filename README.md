Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project

Overview:
This project involves analyzing the business data of Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a mock movie rental company transitioning from physical stores to an online video rental service. The analysis aims to provide insights into various aspects of the company's operations using SQL queries, supporting Rockbuster's 2020 strategy to stay competitive against major streaming services.

Project Context:
As a mock data analyst at Rockbuster Stealth, I was tasked with leveraging the company's existing movie licenses to bolster its new online platform. This involved loading and querying data from a PostgreSQL database to answer key business questions for strategic decision-making.

Data:
The mock dataset includes information on Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The data is stored in PostgreSQL.

Key Questions Addressed:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What is the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
